# treehouse-bot

## Bot features

⋅⋅* Equipped with moderation. (kick, warn, mute and ban)

⋅⋅* Has a command in which you can check the amount of bans, kicks, warns, and mutes a staff member has. (To keep track of how much they actually moderate.)

⋅⋅* Has a command to check how many times each user has been warned, muted, kicked or banned.

⋅⋅* It would be nice if it followed a format [prefix][ban][reason], [prefix][kick][reason], [prefix][warn][reason], [prefix][mute][time][reason].

⋅⋅* When a staff member uses a moderation command, that message should be auto deleted. Example [-b @user raid] should be auto deleted.

⋅⋅* A command to make suggestions would be nice as well, where all suggestions will go into the suggestions channel upon use of the command being used in any channel. A thumps up and thumbs down reaction should also be automatically added to each suggestion message in the channel.

⋅⋅* A command to report members that will immediately get sent to a channel only staff have access to would also be greatly appreciated. Should follow a [prefix][report][@user][reason] format. The message should be auto deleted wherever it is sent, but message saying their report has been sent can stay.
